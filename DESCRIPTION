Description: he `Stdyndef` package implements a novel spatiotemporal modeling framework that
    incorporates dynamic deformation to account for changes in the spatial correlation structure
    over time. This approach generalizes models that use spatial deformation and is particularly
    suited for nonstationary covariance structures. The package is applied to 15 years of monthly
    average temperature data from Southern Brazil, addressing the influence of geographic diversity
    and meteorological phenomena on spatial correlation. Parameters are estimated using Bayesian
    methods with MCMC sampling.
