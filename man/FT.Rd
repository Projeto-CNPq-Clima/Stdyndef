\title{Covariate Matrix for State-Space Model at Time t = 1}
\format{
A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{n} columns:
\describe{
\item{p}{Number of covariates or predictors in the model.}
\item{n}{Number of spatial locations being observed.}
}
}
\usage{
FT
}
\description{
The \code{FT} matrix provides the covariates used in the state-space model specifically at time \code{t = 1}.
This matrix is essential for the initial spatiotemporal analysis, representing the influence of
various predictors on the state of the system at each observation location.
}
\details{
The \code{FT} matrix is a time-dependent covariate matrix used in the state-space model to capture the
relationship between the observed data and the underlying state variables specifically at time \code{t = 1}.
Each row corresponds to a specific covariate, while each column corresponds to a location in space.
This structure allows for the integration of multiple predictors in the spatiotemporal modeling process.
