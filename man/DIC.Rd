\title{Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for Spatiotemporal Model with Dynamic Deformation}
\usage{
DIC(MCMC_output, response, FT, MatFFT, GT, sites, GAMA)
}
\arguments{
\item{MCMC_output}{A list containing the output from the \code{SpatialDeformationMCMC} function, which includes
the posterior samples needed to compute the deviance.}

\item{response}{A matrix of observed values for the response variable across multiple time points and locations.}

\item{FT}{A covariate matrix for the model at time \code{t = 1}.}

\item{MatFFT}{A matrix containing vectorized covariate matrices for each time step, where each row represents
the covariates at a given time in a vectorized form.}

\item{GT}{An evolution matrix used in the state-space model.}

\item{sites}{A matrix containing the geographic coordinates of the observation locations.}

\item{GAMA}{A matrix that defines subsets of time indices to partition the time series into \code{q} disjoint groups.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{DIC}{The Deviance Information Criterion, a measure of model fit and complexity. Lower values indicate a better balance between fit and complexity.}
\item{Pd}{The effective number of parameters, representing the complexity of the model.}
\item{mean_deviance}{The posterior mean deviance, reflecting the fit of the model to the observed data.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for a spatiotemporal model with dynamic deformation
and nonstationary covariance structures. The DIC is used to assess model fit while penalizing model
complexity, facilitating model comparison and selection.
}
\details{
The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) is calculated based on the posterior samples obtained from
the \code{SpatialDeformationMCMC} function. It balances model fit and complexity, providing a measure
that penalizes models with higher complexity (more parameters) while favoring good fit to the data.
The DIC is particularly useful in a Bayesian framework, allowing for model comparison and selection.
