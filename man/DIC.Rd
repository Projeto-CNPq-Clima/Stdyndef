\usage{
DIC(output, response, FT, MatFFT, GT, sites, GAMA)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{a value}

\item{response}{A matrix of observed values for the response variable, with dimensions \code{Txn}, where \code{T} is the length of the time series and \code{n} is the number of locations.}

\item{FT}{A covariate matrix with dimensions \code{pxn}, where \code{p} is the number of coefficients and \code{n} is the number of locations for time \code{t = 1}.}

\item{MatFFT}{A covariate matrix with dimensions \code{Tx(pxn)}. Each row contains the vectorized elements of the \code{FT} matrix for each time \code{t}.}

\item{GT}{An evolution matrix with dimensions \code{pxp}.}

\item{sites}{A matrix \code{nx2} containing the geographic coordinates of the locations.}

\item{GAMA}{A matrix with dimensions \code{qxr} such that \code{q * r = T}. Each row contains the positions of the set \verb{AT = \{1, ..., T\}}, defining the subset \code{GAMA_i = AT[GAMA[i,]]} for \verb{i = 1, ..., q}. The \code{GAMA} matrix must guarantee a partition of \code{AT}, meaning that \verb{GAMA_i ∩ GAMA_j} is empty for all \verb{i ≠ j}, and the union of all \code{GAMA_i} equals \code{AT}.

#' @param GAMA A matrix that defines subsets of time indices to partition the time series into \code{q} disjoint groups.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{DIC}{The Deviance Information Criterion, a measure of model fit and complexity. Lower values indicate a better balance between fit and complexity.}
\item{Pd}{The effective number of parameters, representing the complexity of the model.}
\item{mean_deviance}{The posterior mean deviance, reflecting the fit of the model to the observed data.}
}

\details{
The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) is calculated based on the posterior samples obtained from
the \code{SpatialDeformationMCMC} function. It balances model fit and complexity, providing a measure
that penalizes models with higher complexity (more parameters) while favoring good fit to the data.
The DIC is particularly useful in a Bayesian framework, allowing for model comparison and selection.
