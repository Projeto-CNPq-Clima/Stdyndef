\title{Partition Matrix for Time Indices in State-Space Model}
\format{
A matrix with \code{q} rows and \code{r} columns:
\describe{
\item{q}{Number of subsets of \code{AT}.}
\item{r}{Number of time indices within each subset, such that \code{q * r = T}.}
}
}
\usage{
GAMA
}
\description{
The \code{GAMA} matrix defines a partition of time indices for use in the state-space model. With dimensions
\verb{q x r} such that \code{q * r = T}, this matrix organizes the time index set \verb{AT = \{1, ..., T\}} into subsets.
Each row of \code{GAMA} contains the indices that form a subset of \code{AT}, ensuring that each subset is unique
and non-overlapping, and that the union of all subsets covers the entire set \code{AT}.
}
\details{
The \code{GAMA} matrix is structured to create a partition of the time index set \verb{AT = \{1, ..., T\}}. Each row
\code{i} of \code{GAMA} corresponds to a subset \code{GAMA_i = AT[GAMA[i,]]} for \verb{i = 1, ..., q}. This partitioning is
such that:
\itemize{
\item Each subset \code{GAMA_i} is disjoint from all other subsets, i.e., \verb{GAMA_i ∩ GAMA_j} is empty for all \verb{i ≠ j}.
\item The union of all subsets \code{GAMA_i} equals \code{AT}, ensuring complete coverage of the time indices.
}

This partitioning is useful for spatiotemporal models where temporal indices are grouped for analysis
across different time segments or batches.
