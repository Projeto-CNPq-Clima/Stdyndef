\title{Covariate Matrix for State-Space Model at Each Time Step (Vectorized)}
\format{
A matrix with \code{T} rows and \code{p * n} columns:
\describe{
\item{T}{The number of time steps in the model.}
\item{p * n}{The number of covariate elements for each time step, where \code{p} is the number of covariates
and \code{n} is the number of spatial locations. Each row is a vectorized representation of the \code{FT} matrix
at a given time step.}
}
}
\usage{
MatFFT
}
\description{
The \code{MatFFT} matrix provides the covariates for the state-space model across multiple time steps,
where each row represents the \code{FT} matrix (covariate matrix at a specific time \code{t}) in a vectorized form.
This structure enables efficient handling of time-dependent covariates across all observed time steps.
}
\details{
The \code{MatFFT} matrix is constructed by vectorizing the \code{FT} matrix for each time step and stacking these
vectorized matrices row-wise. Thus, the first row contains the vectorized \code{FT} matrix for time \code{t = 1},
the second row contains the vectorized \code{FT} matrix for time \code{t = 2}, and so on. This structure facilitates
the incorporation of time-varying covariates in the state-space model.
