\title{Covariate Matrix for Unobserved Locations in the Spatiotemporal Model}
\format{
A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{n_unobs} columns:
\describe{
\item{p}{The number of covariates or predictors in the model.}
\item{n_unobs}{The number of spatial locations where the process was not observed.}
}
}
\usage{
FTNO
}
\description{
The \code{FTNO} matrix provides the covariates for locations where the spatiotemporal process was not observed.
This matrix is used during interpolation to estimate the process at these unobserved locations.
}
\details{
The \code{FTNO} matrix contains the covariate values corresponding to the locations where the spatiotemporal
process was not observed. These covariates are used in conjunction with the model to interpolate the
process at unobserved locations. Each row represents a covariate, and each column corresponds to a
specific unobserved location.

This matrix is crucial for extending the model's predictions to areas without direct observations,
enabling spatial interpolation and prediction tasks.
